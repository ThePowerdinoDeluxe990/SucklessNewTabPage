# SNTP - Suckless New Tab Page 
A simple, minimal, barebones new tab page.

I made this extension because, beside Chromium (Chrome) and firefox, the other browsers new tab page implementations, are too bloated or doesn't have support for different type of images (like gifs).
I made this extension because,the other new tab pages extensions are closed source or with a lot of ui elements.

### SNTP is:
Minimal by design (without ui elements that I don't use 99% of time).
Fixes wallpaper image issues.
Does one thing, very well

### TODO
add color backgrounds
add a better UI for the wallpaper picker
add icons

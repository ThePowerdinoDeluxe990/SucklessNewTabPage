# SNTP - Suckless New Tab Page 
A simple, minimal, barebones new tab page.

I made this extension because, besides Chromium (Chrome) and firefox, the other browsers new tab page implementations, are or too bloated or they don't have support for different type of images (like gifs).
And I didn't really like other new tab pages extensions, because they are closed source or have a lot of ui elements and options that I never use.

### SNTP is:
Minimal by design (without ui elements that I don't use 99% of time).
Fixes wallpaper image issues.
This extension doesn't seek to do alot of things, It tries to do one thing, pretty well.


### TODO
* add color backgrounds
* add a better UI for the wallpaper picker
* add icons
